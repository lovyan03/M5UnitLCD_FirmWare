## About Unit LCD

 - Unit LCD is an I2C unit with ESP32 and ST7789V2.
 - It has an IPS panel with a resolution of 135 x 240.
 - The number of colors that can be displayed is 262,144 colors of RGB666, which is the specification of ST7789V2.
 - The ESP32 is in charge of I2C communication and draws in the frame buffer in memory based on the received contents.
 - The contents of the frame buffer in the memory of the ESP32 are reflected in ST7789V2 by DMA transfer of SPI communication.
 - It is represented by RGB888 16,777,216 colors on the framebuffer.


## About Communication with Unit LCD

 - You can send commands and receive data to the Unit LCD using I2C communication.
 - The maximum communication speed of I2C communication is 400kHz.
 - The initial value of the 7-bit address of I2C is 0x3E. It can be changed with the CHANGE_ADDR command.
 - The required number of bytes to send depends on the command.<br>Some commands complete in 1 Byte, while others require 7 Byte.<br>There are also indefinite length commands that do not end until communication is stopped.
 - If I2C communication STOP or RESTART occurs during command transmission, the interrupted command will not be processed.<br>It must be transmitted uninterrupted to the end in a single transmission sequence.
 - After sending a fixed-length command, you can send another command in succession.
 - After sending an indefinite-length command, I2C communication must be stopped to indicate the end of the command.
 - If you send a NOP command or an undefined command, the communication content is ignored until I2C communication stops.
 - Since the I2C communication unit and the drawing processing unit operate in parallel, I2C communication can be performed even during the drawing processing.
 - The I2C communication contents are stored in the command buffer on the ESP32 memory, and the drawing processing unit processes this sequentially.
 - You should use the READ_BUFCOUNT command to check the remaining amount of the buffer , as sending a large amount of heavy processing, such as extensive fill or range copy, can overwhelm the command buffer.


## About drawing commands

 - You can draw a rectangle by filling any area with a single color with FILLRECT.
 - If you want to draw only one pixel, you can use DRAWPIXEL instead of FILLRECT.
 - If you use a command that omits the foreground color, the last used color is used.
 - You can specify the drawing range with CASET and RASET and send the image data with the WRITE_RAW command.
 - You can use WRITE_RLE instead of WRITE_RAW to send run-length compressed image data.

## Communication example

##### Example: Use the Fill Rectangle command 0x6A to fill the rectangle range of X16-31 and Y32-47 with red.

|index| hex | description             |
|:---:|:---:|:------------------------|
|  0  |0x6A |Fill rectangle (RGB565)  |
|  1  |0x10 |X Left                   |
|  2  |0x20 |Y Top                    |
|  3  |0x1F |X Right                  |
|  4  |0x2F |Y Bottom                 |
|  5  |0xF8 |Color data(RRRRRGGG)     |
|  6  |0x00 |Color data(GGGBBBBB)     |

The command 6Ah is a total of 7Byte command sequence.
If an I2C communication STOP or RESTART occurs during transmission, the command will not be processed.
It is necessary to transmit without interruption until the end in a single transmission sequence.

Any of the rectangle fill commands 68h to 6Ch can be used for rectangle fill.
Indexes 1 through 4 are the same, but indexes 5 and onward have different methods for specifying colors.

The "remembered color" of command 68h means that the last specified color will be reused.
In other words, if you want to do several rectangular fills of the same color in succession, you can specify the color only for the first rectangular fill and then omit the color specification by using the 68h command.

Command 6Ch, ARGB8888, allows you to specify an alpha channel (transparency), which allows you to combine the already drawn content with the drawing color.

##### Example: Using the range specification command 0x2A/0x2B and the image transmission command, draw an image in the rectangular range of X 10 to 13 and Y 14 to 17.

|index| hex | description             |
|:---:|:---:|:------------------------|
|  0  |0x2A |X-direction range selection|
|  1  |0x0A |X Left(10)               |
|  2  |0x0D |X Right(13)              |
|  3  |0x2B |Y-direction range selection|
|  4  |0x0E |Y Top(14)                |
|  5  |0x11 |Y Bottom(17)             |
|  6  |0x43 |Draw image RGB888        |
| 7-54| ??  |Image data(RGB888 ×16)  |

---

##### Example: Sending an RLE (run length encoding) image using the WRITE_RLE command.

 - The RLE specification is based on the RLE for BMP files.
 - Unlike RLE for BMP files, it can be used for RGB565 and RGB888.
 - It first sends a consecutive number of pixels of the same color (0-255), followed by the color data.
 - If 0 is sent to a consecutive number, it will be in direct mode without using RLE.
 - In direct mode, the number of pixels (1-255) is sent first, followed by the color data for the number of pixels.


|index|  hex | description             |
|:---:|-----:|:------------------------|
|  0  |  0x4A|Draw RLE image RGB565    |
|  1  |  0x07|consecutive number (7pixel)|
| 2-3 |0xF800|color data (red)         |
|  4  |  0x00|consecutive number (0pixel)<br>switch to direct mode|
|  5  |  0x03|consecutive number of direct mode(3pixel)|
| 6-7 |0x07E0|color data (green)       |
| 8-9 |0x001F|color data (blue)        |
|10-11|0xF800|color data (red)         |
| 12  |  0x04|consecutive number (4pixel)|
|13-14|0x001F|color data (blue)        |

The above example will be handled as follows.
 - index1-3 : Draw 7 pixels of red in RLE mode.
 - index4-5 : Switch to direct mode and instruct it to draw 3 pixels.
 - index6-11: Sends the color for 3 pixels in direct mode and draws green, blue, and red.
 - Since the direct mode for 3 pixels is completed by index11, we will return to the RLE mode from index12.
 - index12-14 : Draws 4 pixels of blue in RLE mode.
